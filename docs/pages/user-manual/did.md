# DID

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Distributed Identifiers (DIDs) is a standard that enables verifiable, decentralised digital identities for any subject (e.g., a person, organisation, thing, or data model). The Dyne.org Foundation has registered a specific method : [Dyne.org DID](https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/) with the [W3C standards body](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods) and implemented its software controller to support the Interfacer project.


The W3C DID implementation provides a core building block for federated systems by allowing for interoperability and seamless data migration between components, including digital product passports of digital twins. The system offers a way to identify and authenticate any entity in the FabCity federated network, regardless of where they operate within the federated system or even outside of it, by using decentralised and distributed identifiers. It allows for each component's independent and autonomous operation while enabling communication and data sharing.

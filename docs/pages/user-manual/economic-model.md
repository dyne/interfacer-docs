# Economic Model
The Interfacer Project follows an Economic Model inspired by Keynesian economics named "**Creative Flows**." Its aim is to distribute value throughout the supply chain, tracing the effort of contributors and displaying which projects generate more involvement and participation. This system allows for transparent value redistribution to ensure fair compensation for all contributors.

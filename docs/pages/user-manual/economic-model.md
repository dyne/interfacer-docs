# Economic Model
The Interfacer Project follows an Economic Model inspired by Keynesian economics named "**Creative Flows**." Its aim is to distribute value throughout the supply chain, tracing the effort of contributors and displaying which projects generate more involvement and participation. This system allows for transparent value redistribution to ensure fair compensation for all contributors.

## Creative Flows
This is an extract from **_Creative Flows_**, _an Economic model for distributed design and production_ (Denis Roio, Stefano Lucarelli)

[...] We based our implementation on the organisation of meaningful data and interactions for which the FabCity OS constitutes an advanced accounting system. We organise the record of all exchanges according to a Resource-Event-Agent accounting system (REA) whose data rests on a Graph database that documents all relationships and offers an easy way to search through them. Then we apply the Valueflows vocabulary as one possible semantic organisation of this data. By doing so, we use "points" to the interactions between Agents, for instance, the agreed offer and provision of contributions to projects. The points are of two different kinds to map two different dimensions in Keynesian economics: 

ðŸ’¡ Idea points -> debt 

ðŸ’ª Strength points -> credit 

This configuration contemplates the existence of agents acting as Entrepreneurs within a network and proposing their "ideas" as possible projects on which the collective (one or more federated FabCities) may decide to invest. 

# How it works
This system allows us to track the contributions on the projects made by each contributor, measuring the "ðŸ’ª_strength_" in terms of the effort they put into them. 

At the same time, we also track the "ðŸ’¡_idea_" proposed by the project owners, assigning "ðŸ’¡_idea_" points for the investment made by the collective. 

This way, we can trace the value creation throughout the supply chain and redistribute it in a transparent way, based on the effort and contribution made. Overall, our goal is to encourage participation and involvement, promoting a fair distribution of value in the open source hardware community.

## Points

The Idea Points and Strengths Points are assigned in different situations related to projects and contributions.

> Note: It is important to keep in mind that the values assigned to each action are hypothetical and subject to change based on the economic model and policies implemented by the Interfacer Project.

## ðŸ’¡ Idea point
(value expressed in cents)

- 100 when someone forks your project: which means they create a new project based on your original project.
- 100 when you create a project: when you create a new project on the Interfacer platform.
- 100 when you add someone as a contributor: when you invite someone to collaborate on your project as a contributor.
- 10 when your project is starred: when a user marks your project as a favorite by clicking on the star icon.
- 10 when your project is watched: when a user chooses to receive notifications for updates on your project, which means they are interested in following its progress.
- 100 when you accept a contribution to your project: when you approve a contribution from a user to your project.
- 100 when you include a relation to a design in a project: when you use a design from another project in your own project.

## ðŸ’ª Strength point
(value expressed in cents)

- 100 when you fork an asset: when you create a new project based on someone else's original project.
- 100 when creating a project: when you create a new project on the Interfacer platform.
- 100 when you are added as a contributor: when a project owner invites you to collaborate on their project as a contributor.
- 100 when your contribution is accepted: when a project owner approves your contribution to their project.
- 100 when your project is included as relation the design of a project: when another user uses your design in their own project or cites your project as a reference.

These values aim to incentivize participation and collaboration on the Interfacer platform, while also providing a way to track and distribute value through the supply chain. However, it is important to note that the Interfacer Project's economic model is subject to change as the platform evolves and as feedback is received from the community.

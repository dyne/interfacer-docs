## Features

Here is a quick preview of some of the features of Interfacer.

### Projects
Create, share, and collaborate on your open source hardware projects using our user-friendly creation form. With fields for project title, description, tags, images, and documentation, you can provide all the necessary information for others to understand and contribute to your project. Plus, with features like version control, licensing options, and project updates, you can ensure that your project is always up-to-date and accessible to a global community of makers, designers, and engineers.

### Design, Products, Services

Designs, products, and services are the three types of projects that can be created on our platform. A design is a documented plan or schematic for making a product, while a product is a physical item made according to a design. A service, on the other hand, is a non-physical offering that provides a solution or meets a need. When creating a project, users can choose the appropriate type based on the nature of their work. Additionally, users can search for and discover these projects on our platform using various search criteria, such as tags, users, location, and more.

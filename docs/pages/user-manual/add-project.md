# Relations: connect several projects into a new one 
When creating or exploring Open Source Hardware (OSH) projects, it's important to understand the relationships between them. 

Projects can be related in many ways, such as through design inspiration, collaboration, or shared components. You can use the "**_Relation_**" feature to link your project to others that share similar goals or components, making it easier for others to find and contribute to your project. Additionally, by exploring related projects, you can find new ideas and potential collaborators for your own OSH projects.

## Relations and DPP
The **_Digital Product Passport (DPP)_** is a tool that allows users to keep track of important information about their open hardware project, such as its design, components, and production processes. With the DPP, users can easily share information about their project with others and ensure that everyone has access to accurate and up-to-date information. 

Additionally, the DPP can be used to track the relationships between different open hardware projects, allowing users to easily identify dependencies and potential areas for collaboration.
